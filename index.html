									<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Project ideas:</span></h2>
									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>My Project is about Myki system for ticketing. Benefiting for customers and getting used to a new system. The changes I will be having a faster software system to for tapping on, my project will be including a safer and faster experience where user will be able to go through the tapping the Myki without a worry however software system safer for fines. The Myki will also give access able to pay online for myki on the phone or any technology by only card instead of going to the machine to always pay because some customer just wants just tap and get on the train instead of having to go through the machine to pay and be late for work or important meeting. I use a Myki software to pay online through ecteronic. </p>
									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>I really want do the Myki system to pay by card online which will be though using devices because sometimes customer have important matters, this will be useful for the public importantly the people whom travel everyday by public transport, however I also want the customers to able check their balance on there device of how many money there is on their Myki card. This will show improvements how customer have benefits of having to use a Myki system on their device I really want to do this because people have been in rushing to get into the train without having tap on because they have not enough money which leads to getting a fine that is $223 or have to pay $75 on the spot.</p>
								<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>The myki card app is designed for customer that have trouble using the machine and waiting for people to fill up the Myki itâ€™s also important to customer from using this this app there are strength and weakness from using this app the strength of using this app is it easy for customers to just pay online using the app and just tap on an get on the train the Myki app will always be updated 
However, on the weakness the app will be having able locate your old myki that maybe loss.
which the app includes for users to pay by card online and putting money as they just have to tap on the train and check the money balance by using this app it will insure the customers access. This app will have a number or code which will have for every card they use however the code is not on the card but itâ€™s on their emails or phone by message which will have to put in the app when they ask the code will only have your details not any other. This will give user privacy of their card and if they lose the Myki card there will have to buy another card and it will be the different code because its different Myki however the code forms the other Myki that was lost will be deleted and all the money that was from it from the database so the person picks up canâ€™t use the Myki. This app will be focusing on functionality by the buttons and how useful the app is designed 
</p>                  
									<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
									<p>The tools and technologies that will be generated in building an using software and hardware I am going to use derive such as phones, laptops and other device that can be able to process money into the Myki which will have software app which will be access form android, Apple or any other software it will include an app that will be to access from the country of region which the phone already will set automatically for example Melbourne, Sydney or any other state. The Myki app will able to click on Tram, Train or Bus and the destination or location that you put. The Myki system will make sure to improve in the future to better system for the public. There hardware system will be generated by an operating system will give people to use their card and check the money balance</p>
									<h2>Skills Required</h2>
									<p>The Skills that are required is:<br />
-	Understanding a mobile user interface- This will make sure the user and the software will connect and the app will be able to make it easy to use for the user and well designed and organised
-	App development<br /> - should able to use bot android an IOS users which can be able to put coding in many devices.<br />
-	I will be using java script, html and CSS to develop the application in coding <br />
These skills will be necessary for the app that will be created to help the Myki system to better within using software and hardware</p>
									<h2>Outcome</h2>
									<p>If the Myki system goes successfully and benefit for the public it and makes difference to the Myki software it will have an impact by continuing using this software app and by making small changes and upgrading the system to extent that public transport wonâ€™t be problem. Myki system will develop and easy approach for customers that will use. If there have negative impacts then the app will be improving to become more efficient by using safer privacy as numbers accounts while putting in money. The app will bring a new generation of proccing money to the Myki card and checking the system if there is no money.</p>
